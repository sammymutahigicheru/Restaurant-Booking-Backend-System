   After Setting up the database, create database tables running the command below, its advisable to run the command more than once and make sure your database is updated with the tables:

   ```
   Start server by running:

   ```shell
   $ npm run start
   ```
   Seed Database tables with users(with admin right) by running the command below, its advisable to run it more than once:
